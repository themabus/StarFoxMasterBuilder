# Star Fox Master Builder
Original SNES Star Fox source code restored to produce 1:1 retail ROM releases on compile.
Could be of interest for translations, modding, speedrunning, digital archeology or you, perhaps.

So I was tired working on an project and went tinkering with SF source as a distraction. 
I thought restoring a source code was an interesting challange to brush up on reverse engineering. 
+Nobody seemed to be doing this.

Got these releases restored and compiling so far:

Currently working on US/JP Rev1. If I'll finish those, will do Rev2 next. Don't really care about PAL or Weekend/CES thing.

Upload will be a diff patch file for you to apply on your SG.LZH/MAPS.LZH content - so no dodgy source files hosted here.
Go away, %$#tendo!

If you are interested in the subject of reverse engineering but are unsure where to start, [might as well start here](http://www.woodmann.com/fravia/academy.htm).
It's an oldskool place, a bit dusty, but principles you'll find there are largely universal and can be applied to more current systems just the same.
