# StarFoxMasterBuilder
Original SNES Star Fox source code restored to produce 1:1 retail releases on compile.

So I was tired working on an project and went tinkering with SF source as a little distraction. 
Got original US retail restored already. Now working on JP.
If I'll finish that, will do US/JP Rev1, then Rev2. Don't really care about PAL or Weekend/CES thing.

Upload will be a diff patch file for you to apply on your SG.LZH content - so no dodgy source files hosted here.
Go away, %$#tendo!
